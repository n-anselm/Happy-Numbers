# Happy-Numbers

This is a simple GUI program made with PyQt. It takes any positive integer, replaces the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeats the process until the number is 1, or loops in a cycle (max loops set to 100) which does not produce 1. A number is a "happy number" if the process produces 1.
